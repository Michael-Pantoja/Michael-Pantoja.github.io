											<h2>Before We Begin</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I would like to preface this post by stating that this was a project I had been wanting to do with my friends for quite some time.
											I never truly intended on making the code I created to be used a source for other people to repeat the process and as a result the code is not the cleanest.
											It is for that reason that I have opted out of creating a Github repo out of this project and instead using snippets from the code that I find to be relevant.
											With that being said, it's time to bake!
										</p>
											<h2>Step 1: Getting an Idea</h2>
										<p>Before we truly begin, I always find it important to understand what it is we are actually trying to accomplish. 
											The goal of this project is to try to create a deep learning model that takes various recipes as its input and then output a single recipe for us to use.
											It's better to try to be as specific as possible, and as a result, I decided to try to create the best chocolate cake recipe.
											There is no particular reason for why I chose chocolate cake other than the fact that there has to be thousands upon thousands of different chocolate cake recipes,
											thus, making it a good candidate.
										</p>
											<h2>Step 2: Getting Supplies</h2>
										<p> Now that we have a direction that we want to head in, we can start getting to work. The first real step is getting all the recipes.
											The simplest way to accomplish this is by finding a baking website and scraping the site for chocolate cake recipes. And that's what I did.
											I'm not one that bakes so I wasn't sure if there was a go-to site when it comes to cakes so I chose one at random and landed on <a href = 'https://www.mybakingaddiction.com/'>"My Baking Addiction"</a>.
										</p>
										<p>
											Now that we have a site that we want to use, we can create a simple Python scraper to pull out the directions of the recipes we want.
											We want to make sure that we are filtering by "chocolate cake" so that we are not flooded with unrelated recipes.
											To do that, I wrote some code that looks like the following:
										</p>
										<pre><code>
									import requests
									from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
									import re
									import pandas as pd
									
									search_term = 'Chocolate Cake'
									search_term = search_term.replace(' ', '+')
									
									url = f'https://www.mybakingaddiction.com/?s={search_term}'
									page = requests.get(url).text
									doc = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
									
									page_text = doc.find_all(class_='page-numbers')[3]
									pages = int(str(page_text).split('>')[-2].split('<')[0])
									
									links = []
									titles = []
									for i in tqdm(range(1, pages + 1)):
									
									page_url = f'https://www.mybakingaddiction.com/page/{i}/?s={search_term}'
									print(page_url)

									page_info = requests.get(page_url).text
									page_doc = BeautifulSoup(page_info, 'html.parser')
									article_finder = page_doc.find_all(class_='article excerpt')
									for article in article_finder:
									
										articles = article.find_all(class_='excerpt-title')

										for subject in articles:
										
											for items in subject.find_all('a', href=True):

												links.append(items['href'])

												titles.append((str(items.text).encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode()))


									df = pd.DataFrame()
										
									df['Title'] = titles
									df['url'] = links

									df.to_csv('recipe_list.csv', index = False)
											</code>
										</pre>
										<p>
											This block of code may seem a bit overwhleming but if we take a look at it, piece by piece, then we can see that it's actually quite simple.
											To begin we are copying the format of what the website url looks like whenever an item is searched. In our case,
											the string of text after <code>/?s</code> in the url is what dictates what is searched. With this piece of information,
											we can now search for whatever we want directly through Python.
										</p>
										<h2>Step 3: Mixing It All Up</h2>
										<p>
											Afterwards, the next big step is actually pulling the relevant information from the search page. In our case, we want to
											pull all the different urls for each recipe that appears after we commence our search. This is what the next chunk of code is doing.
											It's first digging through the HTML tree that makes up the website and determining how many pages worth of results we got. This is important
											because we need to tell our code what the last page of results is. We can iterate through each article and place the title of it as well as the
											accompanying URL into a database. This step isn't necessary but I like to be organized with my work, especially in the early stages.
										</p>
										<p>
											The final part of the gathering stage is actually obtaining the recipe. Now that we have every single article URL from every possible page,
											we can now loop through each page and pull any relevant information. Thanks to the way the website is formatted, all baking directions are organized
											in an HTML class titled <code>"mv-create-instructions"</code>. We can iterate through every URL that we stashed in our database and pull
											all the relevant information from the instructions class. The code will look something like the following:

											<pre><code>
									for index, row in tqdm(df.iterrows()):
									url = row['url']
									print(url)
									info = requests.get(url).text
									doc = BeautifulSoup(info, 'html.parser')
									try:
										instruction_paragraph = doc.find("div", {"class": "mv-create-instructions"}).find_all('li')
										instruction_lines = []
								
										for i in instruction_paragraph:
											instruction_lines.append(i.text.strip())
								
										instruction_lines = ' '.join(instruction_lines)
										instructions.append(instruction_lines)
								
									except AttributeError:
										pass			
											</code></pre>
										</p>
										<h2>Step 4: Into The Machine</h2>
										<p>
											Now that we have a database that holds all the ingredients, we are now ready to input the data into a neural network.
											For our case, I decided to use a <strong>R</strong>ecurrent <strong>N</strong>eural <strong>N</strong>etwork (RNN) as our driving force.
											Once we start entering the realm of neural networks and deep learning, a lot of crucial infromation can be lost to technical jargon, so I
											will do my best to summarize what an RNN is. Essentially, an RNN works by using an internal memory to keep track of an input as well as what
											are the inputs that are followed. This is exteremely helpful in our case because we will be able to see if there are any patterns in our text.
											A pattern in our context may mean that there is a similar ingredient (not including chocolate) or step that is shared amongst all recipes that
											may be deemed important. In addition to knowing about the immediate future, since RNN's are recurring, they also can keep track of what happened
											prior to the current instance. A basic visualization of an RNN is as follows:

										<br/>
										<br/>
										<p>
											The input for this model is of course the multiple baking instructions that we were able to pull earlier. Trying to explain the
											hidden layers through Python is beyond the scope of this blog post but if one is interested, then I highly recommend checking out
											this <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation">RNN tutorial</a> that uses the TensorFlow library. That was
											actually the resource I used when I embarked on this project. As with any deep learning model, there are multiple parameters that 
											one can tinker with in order to get a proper result. Given that this project was just for fun, I didn't spend too much time perfecting
											my model nor did I create any hyperparameters. That will be left as an exercise for the reader.
										</p>
											<h2>Step 5: Enjoy</h2>
										<p>
											After following the instructions that the TensorFlow documentation displayed, we are now able to get the <strong>perfect</strong> chocolate cake recipe.
											After inputting all the baking instructions and setting my barebone model and training with 30 epochs, we are greeted with a recipe:
										</p>
										<p style=color:darkslategrey>
										" <strong>

										"
										</p>
										<p>
											That doesn't make much sense. For that reason I tried again but lowering the epochs down to 15 instead of 30. This resulted in the following:
										</p>
										<p style=color:darkslategrey>
											" <strong>

											I don't think this is much better. Now normally, I wouldn't leave a project on a cliffhanger or without a satisfying ending,
											but as aforementioned, this was a quick project that I made for fun to share with friends. It's not really meant to be polished.
											With that being said, if you would like to see how we interpreted these recipes and actually baked a cake following the instructions
											created by our RNN model, feel free to watch the YouTube video we created!
