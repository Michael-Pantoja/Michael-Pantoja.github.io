											<h2><strong>A Simple Line</strong></h2>
										</header>
										<p> Before we begin to even talk about matrices and linear algebra, it's important to start off with the basics and build our way up.
											Having a fundamental understanding of how the systems at play work will make concepts later on a lot easier to grasp. In terms of
											linear algebra, the simplest place to start is with <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'>vectors</span>.
											To begin, let's imagine we have some arbitrary point on a simple graph. For our example, let's have at the coordinate <strong>( 2 , 1 )</strong></p>
										<center><img src='images/section1-imgs/figure_1.png'></center>
										<p>From here, we can imagine a line that starts at the origin <strong> ( 0 , 0 )</strong>, connecting to this arbitrary point.</p>
										<center><img src='images/section1-imgs/figure_2.png'></center>
										<p>
											At this point you may be asking yourself, <i>"Okay, so what's the big deal? This is just a simple line."</i> and at this point, you would be correct.
											What we have shown here is nothing but an ordinary line. We can figure out what the slope of it is pretty easily (0.5) as well as the y-intercept (0).
											Beyond this, there is not much more we can extrapolate.
										</p>
										<p>
											Next, I am going to replace the line with a vector.
										</p>
										<center><img src='images/section1-imgs/figure_3.png'></center>
										<p>
											At first glance, it looks like the line was replaced with an arrow, and in a way that's true.
											There are two important attributes that quantifies this "arrow" as a vector: <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'>direction</span>
											and <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'>magnitude</span>. Let's break each one down.
										</p>
									</section>
										<h2><strong>Magnitude</strong></h2>
										<p>
											The easiest way to think about magnitude is by imagining that magnitude is essentially the intensity or length of the vector. To find
											the magnitude we can easily use the coordinate of the vector point and plug the numbers into the following:
										</p>
										<p>
											<center>\[\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\]</center>
										</p>

										<p>
											In our case, our vector starts at <strong>( 0 , 0 )</strong> and ends at <strong>( 2 , 1 )</strong>. 
											This leads us with a magnitude of <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'>\(\sqrt{5}\)</span>.
										</p>
										<p>
											This equation can be derived from the Pythagorean and is relatively straight forward. Let's go ahead and add <span style='color: yellow'>another vector</span> to our
											graph and try this equation again.
										</p>
										<p>
											<center><img src='images/section1-imgs/figure_4.png'></center>
										</p>					
										<p>
											Using the equation from earlier, we can plug in the new values from the new vector and get the following:
										</p>					
										<p>
											<center>\[\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\]</center>
											<center>\[\sqrt{(4 - 2)^2 + (4 - 3)^2}\]</center>
											<center>\[\sqrt{5}\]</center>
										</p>								
										<p>
											We find that we also get <span style='color: yellow'>\(\sqrt{5}\)</span> as our answer, even though these
											vectors are not located at the same spot. It's for this reason that it always best to try to have the arrays
											begin at the origin. It makes calculations a lot easier. We just discovered that both of these arrays have the
											same magnitude, so does that mean that these two arrays are the same? Maybe. It is important to notice that there
											are two characteristics that apply to each array. We have simply looked at the magnitude, it is now time to look
											at <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'> direction</span>.
										</p>		
										<h2><strong>Direction</strong></h2>
										<p>
											Finding the direction of an array simply means finding the <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'>angle</span> of that array.
											The typical reference that is used to calculate this angle is the <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'> x-axis</span>. Let's use the same
											array as before. This time we'll be a bit more proper with our notation.
										</p>
										<p>
											<center><img src='images/section1-imgs/figure_5.png'></center>
										</p>										
										<p>
											As we can see, we have introduced a new <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'>\(\theta\)</span> value in addition to properly
											annotating the two ends of our array. The \(\theta\) value represents the angle that we are trying to uncover. If we take a closer look
											at the array and x-axis we might begin to notice something.
										</p>
										<p>
											<center><img src='images/section1-imgs/figure_6.png'></center>
										</p>
										<p>
											It looks just like a triangle! Thinking back to trigonometry, we can see that a simple <i>tan()</i> operation
											can be used here to find the missing angle. All we would need to do is find the length of the adjacent and
											opposite side with the respect to the angle. Luckily, we know how to do that.
										</p>
										<p>
											<center>\[tan\theta = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} =  \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\]</center>
											<br>
											<center>\[tan\theta = \frac{1 - 0}{2 - 0}\]</center>
											<center>\[tan\theta = \frac{1}{2}\]</center>
											<center>\[\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{1}{2})\]</center>
											<center>\[\theta \approx 26.57^\circ\]</center>
										</p>
										<p>
											Working through the simple math, we get answer of approximately <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'>\(26.57^\circ\) </span>.
											Let's see what happens if we use the values for the <span style='color: yellow'>second vector</span> using the same formula.
										</p>
										<p>
											<center>\[tan\theta = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} =  \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\]</center>
											<br>
											<center>\[tan\theta = \frac{4 - 3}{4 - 2}\]</center>
											<center>\[tan\theta = \frac{1}{2}\]</center>
											<center>\[\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{1}{2})\]</center>
											<center>\[\theta \approx 26.57^\circ\]</center>
										</p>
										<p>
											Interesting. So it seems like we get the same exact direction for both vectors. Earlier on we also mentioned that
											both vectors also share the same magnitude. So what does that mean?
										</p>
									<h2><strong>Many As One</strong></h2>
									<p>
										What we just demonstrated is an important concept to understand. Both vectors have the same exact magnitude and direction,
										yet they are not located in the same spot, which means they aren't equal, correct? Not exactly. When working with
										vectors, it doesn't really matter where vectors are located on a graph. The only things that matter is the magnitude and 
										direction. This is all to say that the two vectors we have been looking at are in fact <span style='color:rgb(251, 151, 151)'>equal</span>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Another way to think about this is if we were to "pick up" one of the vectors, let's say the <span style='color: yellow'>yellow vector</span>,
										we would able to perfectly line it up with the other vector on our grid. This concept of equal vectors is something that will become very
										useful to us as we progress through our linear algebra journey.
